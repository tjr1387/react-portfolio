      <p> I was born in Canada, about an hour west of Vancouver, B.C. My father was a Boston sports fan, and I grew to become one also.
        In 1996, he took a job interview in Massachusetts and was offered the position.
        <br></br>
        Growing up I was a relatively serious competetive gymnast, doing it through high school graduation. After graduating from Bishop Guertin (Nashua, NH),
        I attended the College of William and Mary; I was there for roughly 3 years, quitting gymnastics pretty early into that stint, and dropping out!
        I moved back up to New England in 2009 to do what college dropouts in niche sports wind up doing -- coaching that sport. I spent roughly 12 years coaching gymnastics,
        knowing that I eventually would need to do something else if I ever wanted to own a house or have a family. I am now working towards becoming a credible web developer. Fingers crossed!
